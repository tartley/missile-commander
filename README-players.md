# Missile Commander

A 2024 vector graphic remake of the 1980 city defence arcade classic "Missile
Command".

## Status

Playable but unfinished. Missing some planned features (web release, level
differentiation, fancy bomb types, difficulty tuning, credits in-game, high
score, juice including CRT glow, parallax starfield, update notifications)

## Install

Download a Linux or Windows zip file from [Itchio](https://tartley.itch.io/missile-commander).

Extract all files from the zip, and double click the executable program to run.
No install is required.

## Play

Use mouse to aim your cursor. Press left, center, and right mouse buttons to
launch missiles from your three yellow ground bases. Alternatively use keyboard
`A`, `S` and `D` to fire. Use the missiles to protect your red cities from waves
of falling bombs.
