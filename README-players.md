# Missile Commander

A 2024 vector graphic remake of the 1980 city defence arcade classic "Missile Command".

## Status

An unfinished work-in-progress. Playable for 30 seconds, but the initial
wave of bombs just gradually loses steam until all the bombs have fallen
and then nothing happens.

## Install
