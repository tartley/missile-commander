#### v0.14

* Automate the upload of new versions to itch.io
* Fix thousands of log errors of the form "*missile.gd:44 @ destroy(): Node not
  found: 'Trail'*".
* Fix longstanding collision detection bug preventing missiles from being
  destroyed by sky explosions.

#### v0.13

* Game runs, is playable for 30 seconds, correctly handles a "game over" if all
  cities are destroyed, but otherwise the wave of falling missiles just
  gradually runs out, and nothing after that ever happens.

Versions older than this are lost to history.
